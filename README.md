# Data Version Control for Data Science
This repository demonstrates how you can use data version control, which is a way to keep track of changes in various types of files generated during a data science project. Data science involves trying to understand and solve real-world problems by analyzing data, creating interactive reports, dashboards, and building machine learning models.

In a typical data science project, you may work with different types of files such as code files (e.g., Python scripts), data files (e.g., CSV, JSON), plots or visualizations (e.g., PNG, PDF), and machine learning metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall). As you make changes to these files or generate new ones, it becomes challenging to keep track of all the versions and ensure reproducibility.

This is where version control systems like Git come into play. Git is a popular tool that allows you to track changes in your code files and collaborate with others. However, Git is not designed to efficiently handle large binary files like data files or visualizations, which can quickly consume a lot of space in your version control repository.

Data version control tools like DVC (Data Version Control) and Makefiles can help solve this problem. DVC is a tool that helps you track and manage changes in your data files, plots, and machine learning metrics, while keeping the actual data outside of your Git repository. Makefiles are files that define a set of instructions (or rules) for building and managing a project's files and dependencies.

In this repository, we will explore how to use DVC and Makefiles together to create reproducible and easy-to-share workflows for data science projects, competitive data science challenges, and even generative AI ambitions. By using these tools, you can ensure that your work is reproducible, sharable, and easily manageable, even when dealing with large data files or complex experiments.   

## Installation

1. Install Quarto by following the instructions on the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/). Quarto is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

2. Install a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice. Some popular options for data science include:
   - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (with the [Quarto extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto))
   - [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) (with the [Quarto pane](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/rstudio.html))
   - [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/install) (with the [Quarto extension](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/jupyter-lab.html))

3. Install the required programming languages and packages for data science work, such as Python, R, or Julia, along with their respective data analysis libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib for Python; dplyr, ggplot2 for R; DataFrames.jl, Plots.jl for Julia).

## Usage

This repository contains two folders:

1. `datavc_makefile`: This folder demonstrates how to use Makefiles for automating and managing the dependencies in a data science project. Makefiles define a set of rules and instructions for building and processing various files in the correct order.

2. `datavc_full`: This folder demonstrates the combined usage of Makefiles and Data Version Control (DVC). DVC is a tool that helps track changes in data files, plots, machine learning models, and metrics, ensuring reproducibility and shareability of your data science workflows.

To get started, navigate to the desired folder (`datavc_makefile` or `datavc_full`) and follow the instructions provided in the respective README file. These folders contain examples and demonstrations of how to use Makefiles and DVC in practice.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.   
2. Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`  
3. Make your desired changes to the codebase or documentation.  
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`   
5. Push the branch to your forked repository: `git push origin my-new-feature`   
6. Create a new Pull Request on the original repository, describing your changes in detail.     

We encourage you to explore and experiment with different ideas, such as integrating object storage solutions like S3 or Google Cloud Storage for storing and managing data files or using Docker containers for reproducible environments.
